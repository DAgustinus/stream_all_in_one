# Stream All In One
All in one streaming example from random data generator via FastApi, Kafka to capture to receive the data, and eventually MySQL to get the data dumped into. In the future, I will also add a NoSQL Database connection as well.

## Usage
All you have to do is to clone this repo, and run `docker compose up` to run this. Once you do this, you will be able to see the data being generated by the producer.py and consumed by consumer.py script.
